      <description>When I first started writing my GStreamer bindings for go, I had never done C library bindings before. I had written small programs in C for fun, but most of my professional work was either Go, Python, or just pure BASH. I spent a lot of time over in #gstreamer on freenode probably driving the core developers utterly insane.
About half way through this adventure, I was working on the bindings for one of the APIs (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember which) and when inquiring further about it slomo informed me &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s really only used for plugins.</description>
