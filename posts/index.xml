      <description>When I first started writing my GStreamer bindings for go, I had never done C library bindings before. I had written small programs in C for fun, but most of my professional work was either Go, Python, or just pure BASH. I spent a lot of time over in #gstreamer on freenode probably driving the core developers utterly insane.
About half way through this adventure, I was working on the bindings for one of the APIs (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember which) and when inquiring further about it slomo informed me &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s really only used for plugins.</description>

      <description>Back when I was working on kvdi (a Kubernetes-native &amp;ldquo;Virtual Desktop Infrastructure&amp;rdquo; written in Go), I got to the inevitable point that I wanted support for audio streams from the user desktops. In a web-based VDI solution, this posed several challenges:
 Raw PCM data is huge, and as such is not suitable for streaming over low latency networks.  To work with browser-native audio APIs, we need either raw PCM or one from a small set of browser supported encodings (WASM opens more doors, but I wanted to avoid it).</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog where I am going to start documenting my code adventures in more detail.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, constantly going between lockdowns, the one thing I realized I needed the most was my routines. The usual ones were not an option, so I dedicated myself to side projects that ventured me outside of my comfort zone. Regretfully, I didn&amp;rsquo;t blog about them at the time, so this will become a place for me to retroactively go over some of those projects, and to continue documenting new ones in the future 😄.</description>
